# JBL_Soundbar

Integrates a JBL soundbar in Home Assistant


You have to add it to the “custom integration” folder. This folder should be (created) in your config folder. Afterwards restart your home assistant and search for the integration.


This integration is only usable if you're also able to use the 'JBL one' app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jbl.oneapp)
